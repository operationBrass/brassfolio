        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <p>  Having gained certification in 
            ServiceNow Discovery, Azure Cloud Fundamentals and ITIL V4 Foundation, I look to increase my technical abilities. Being apart of the UWA Coding Bootcamp for 2021 
            I have been gaining new skills with HTML, CSS, Javascript including associated frameworks such as Node, Bootstrap, Bulma and more. I look forward to continuing to completion and to keep the improvements coming!
